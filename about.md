# Our project
======
Travelling using human powered bicycles is something fantastic, but limited to a small geographical area because of inevitable human fatigue. Electric bicycles extend their range of applications but they need to recharge using electricity which is still mainly produced releasing greenhouse gases because of the carbonized energy sources used globaly. Hence, in response to surging demand for global environmental preservation, bicycles assisted by solar locally produced electricity may be the most eco-friendly means of touring for middle to long distances. 

Hence, we plan to build technological marvels to reach this goal using the technologies of multiple components including but not limited to: wheels, framesets, drivetrain systems, brakes, tyres, batteries, electrical engines, dynamos, GPS, solar panels and energy management systems. For that, we need the help of the different equipment manufacturers. Indeed, to make equipments work together would be a good demonstration of the gathering of the different equipment manufacturers around a common project.

# About us
======
We are two engineers and PhD students in the field of energy who like to ride bicycles. Recently, we did some bike touring and we liked this way of travelling at a slow pace, taking the time to appreciate the wonderful scenic landscapes.
